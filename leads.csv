A broad analysis of a project’s site conditions, environmental context, program, budget, schedule, and jurisdictional parameters are mined for latent opportunities to be metabolized towards innovative and novel design solutions. Our process resists the autonomous and pure in favor of the dependent, messy, and dirty possibilities of a poetic inclusion of multiple and often conflicting influences. This process ultimately leads to the intersection of architecture, landscape, and urban networks, and the inherent negotiations necessary to implement a coherent experience respectful of the impact upon the environment.', 'Assumptions are challenged. Our understanding of the capacity for design to organize complex systems with thoughtful intention, environmental appropriateness, and a practical dose of both form and function, is coupled with our belief in the responsibility of the designer to ask questions and challenge assumptions of the built environment. Our ongoing interest in developing experiences that explore space, scale, orientation, light, detail, materiality, and emerging technologies is demonstrated in a wide range of residential, institutional, commercial and landscape projects that question, and when appropriate, inflect existing paradigms.', 'Flexibility is required. We do not jump to conclusions; we test conventional and novel solutions to problems with equal fervor. The manipulation and application of accepted organizational typologies, as well as the transposition of foreign typologies are all fair game. Our design process takes into consideration numerous configurations for all projects and attempts to embed conceptual rigor within each.
